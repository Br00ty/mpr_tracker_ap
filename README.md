# SauceRelic's Work
This repository is for projects I've made in my free time. For most of this work, I'm fine with other people modifying it, as long as you give me credit if you redistribute it.

Currently, all that is here are some tracker packages I've made for EmoTracker, which can be found here: https://emotracker.net/
