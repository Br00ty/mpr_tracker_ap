  Fixed missing comma in Lava Lake

v0.9.0.3
  Fixed Crossway logic (now requires supers)
    *** Be aware that this is a deviation from the current randomizer logic, but will soon be fixed. In the mean time, there is a very

v0.9.0.2
  Fixed visors not being in the capture grid

v0.9.0.1
  Fixed burn dome appearing blue even if it should be escapable

v0.9.0.0

  -Upgrade from legacy
  -Add variants

Logic might also need some tweaks, so this release is partially intended for testing.
