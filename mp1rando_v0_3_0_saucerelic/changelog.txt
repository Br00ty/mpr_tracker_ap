v0.9.1.0
  Made sweeping modifications to multiple locations:
  - Made the scan dash for Alcove a glitchless sequence break, as it is a very easy glitch and an early check
  - Added glitchless sequence breaks for frigate that skip thermal visor
  - Added all difficulties sequence break for Cargo Lift to Deck Gamma, as gravity is not required
  - Added visibility for Biohazard Containment if you have xray but can't use supers
  - Added visibility for Gathering hall if you're missing bombs or space
  - Added visibility for Triclops Pit if you're missing xray or space
  - Removed thermal requirements for phendrana pirate facility locations if you enter phendrana backwards
  - Removed normal access section of Research Lab Aether as a result of thermal visor changes
  - Made vanilla path Research Core need either ice or thermal, not both
  - Added sequence break for vanilla path Research core if you memorize thermal spots
  - Cleaned up multiple locations to increase readability and remove unintended redundancy

v0.9.0.6
  Did 0.9.0.5 again but for real

v0.9.0.5
  Added ice beam to Gravity Suit check requirements

v0.9.0.4
  Fixed missing comma in Lava Lake

v0.9.0.3
  Fixed Crossway logic (now requires supers)
    *** Be aware that this is a deviation from the current randomizer logic, but will soon be fixed. In the mean time, there is a very
        rare chance for an unbeatable seed.
  Added Lava Lake sequence break for glitchless (only according to randomizer logic, does not require glitches)

v0.9.0.2
  Fixed visors not being in the capture grid

v0.9.0.1
  Fixed burn dome appearing blue even if it should be escapable

v0.9.0.0
  Unfinished release, still missing a few things like:
	-Custom broadcast layout
	-Custom chest icons
  -Upgrade from legacy
  -Add variants

Logic might also need some tweaks, so this release is partially intended for testing.
